// tlg: automatic quality for inFAMOUS Second Son (tlg_view.cpp). The game has its own ladder of
// 21 dynamic quality levels (shorter LOD, fewer shadow cascades, fewer objects and lights drawn),
// but it climbs it only when its draw lists run out of memory, not when the frame is slow. This
// governor climbs it by frame time instead: it raises the lowest level the game may use when the
// frame rate stays under the target and gives a level back when there is room to spare.
